<h1>AlarmCatcher Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: 17.01.2026</p>

<h2>App</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to the AlarmCatcher Android application (package: <code>com.elburrocorriendo.alarmcatcher</code>) (the “App”).
The App is provided by <strong>El Burro Corriendo</strong> (“Developer”). Contact: <a href="mailto:d5n6bfnyxx@privaterelay.appleid.com">SUPPORT_EMAIL</a>.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The App shows ads using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).</li>
  <li>The Developer does not operate an account system for the App.</li>
  <li>Advertising and measurement may involve collection and sharing of certain device and usage data by the ads SDK.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information processed</h2>
<p>
The App uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). The Google Mobile Ads SDK automatically collects and shares certain data such as IP address,
user product interactions (ad interactions), diagnostic information, and device and account identifiers for advertising, analytics,
and fraud prevention. This data collection/sharing can vary depending on device settings and SDK configuration.
</p>

<h2>How information is used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To serve and display ads.</li>
  <li>To measure ad performance and help prevent fraud and abuse.</li>
  <li>To support app/SDK diagnostics and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>
Advertising-related data may be shared with Google and its partners to provide ads and ad measurement through Google Mobile Ads (AdMob).
</p>

<h2>Consent and choices (Switzerland, EU/EEA, UK, USA, and other regions)</h2>
<p>
Where required (for example EU/EEA and UK), the App requests consent for ad-related processing using Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP)
and/or a Google-certified consent solution. You can change or withdraw your choices using the in-app “Privacy &amp; Ads” option (if present),
or by adjusting your device privacy settings (for example advertising identifier controls).
</p>
<p>
In the USA and other regions, you may have certain privacy rights depending on your location. The App aims to provide controls
through consent/choices and device-level settings where applicable.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact SUPPORT_EMAIL.
</p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>
<p>
The Developer does not store personal data on own servers for this App. Advertising-related retention is handled by Google and partners
under their policies.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
The App uses industry-standard network encryption where supported by the underlying services. Google Mobile Ads SDK data is encrypted in transit
using TLS.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
This policy may be updated. The latest version will be available at this URL with an updated “Last updated” date.
